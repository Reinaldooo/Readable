#### React Nanodegree Program
##### Readable Project
-----
This is an forum app entirely build with React and Redux.
You can read and add posts or comments on multiple categories.

In this project, React its used to build the UI, and Redux its used to manage the global state in a safe, predictable way.

To load it in your local machine:
* Install the latest version of node.js if you don't have it. It comes with npm(node package manager).
Make sure that you install node with the PATH variable so you can run node anywhere in your command prompt/terminal.
* Once node.js is installed, install the react package using this command: `npm install -g create-react-app`
* The environment is now ready. You can now clone this repo and cd into the folder.
* Open two terminal windows on the the cloned folder, then run `cd server` and `npm install` on the first one to install the dependencies.
* On the second one, run `cd frontend` and `npm install` to also install the dependencies.
* Run `npm start` on both windows, and a few seconds later your browser will open up with the app loading.
